 K-fold cross-validation is a technique used to assess and optimize the performance of machine
 learning models. The dataset is divided into K subsets, or ”folds.” The model is trained on K-1 folds
 and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated K times, and the average performance
 is used to gauge the model’s generalization ability.
 For this assignment,
 1. Split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Normalize/Regularize data if
 necessary. Encode categorical variables using appropriate encoding method if necessary.
 2. Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset using saga solver from scikit-learn
 package and using no regularization penalty.
 3. Cross Validate the classifier with 5-folds and print the mean accuracy, precision and
 recall for the class 1(good) for the classifier. You may or may not use the scikit-learn
 implementations for computing these metrics. However, you cannot use any ML package
 for the cross validation logic.
